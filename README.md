# dotfiles

One of my main goals with these configs is trying to squeeze as much functionality out of everything as I can, without having to resort to plugin frameworks and addons that I know I'll never use a fraction of. So my .bashrc, .vimrc, etc. have as many built-in tricks as I can find, and I'm adding new stuff as I go.
